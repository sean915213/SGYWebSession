  "summary": "A collection of extensions on existing classes that make interacting with Apple's Framework easier and more 'Swifty'.",
  "description": "This library provides a lightweight collection of extensions that I've found useful and convenient in my Swift projects. Many of the extensions extend commonly used functions in order to utilize generics (e.g. `dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:forIndexPath:`). Others are simply convenience functions (e.g. the addition of `addViews` to `UIView`).",
